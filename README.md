# Project 1: Flight Satisfaction Analysis
* This projectgoes with:
  1. [Final SQL Script on Google Big Query](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=76270021988:eaac8063c4b741c18028dcaef06c523b) includes:
      1. Data engineering: Checking, Cleaning missing data, Check classes Balancing, Drop redundant variables
      2. Build classification models: Logistics Regression, Decision Tree with ensemble methods, KNN and parameters tunning for best model-Decision Tree
      3. Obtain Linear Function from Logistic Regression and Important Features from Decision Tree's impurity 
      4. Further Analysis on the subset of Type of Customer

  2. [Dataset](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Flight%20Satisfaction/satisfaction_2015.xlsx): Dimension is (129880,23), with 18    variables are on rating scale 0-5, target value is satifaction_v2
  3. [Report](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Flight%20Satisfaction/Flight_Satisfaction_report.pdf): a detail of analysis and interpretion of results is provided with clear suggestion and commnents on the final model
  
# Project 2: Melbourne Housing Analysis
* This projectgoes with:
  1. [Python note book](https://github.com/ThanhNg1712/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Melbourne%20Housing%20Analysis/melbourne-housing-eda-regression-analysis.ipynb) includes
      1. Data engineering: Checking, Cleaning missing data, Check classes Balancing, Drop redundant variables
      2. Data EDA: Visualizations of variables distribution, correlation matrix
      3. Build Regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNEt and Paramaters Tunning with GridSearchCV
      4. The notebook has been included clear comments in each steps
      5. Hypothesis tesing has performed to recognize redundant variables in this note book, best models with parameters are also obtained
